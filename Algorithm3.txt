Hard 3

Input: Take an integer n from the user.

Counting Digit 1:

1.Initialize count to 0.
2.Iterate through powers of 10 (1, 10, 100, ...) until the current power is greater than n.
For each power of 10 (i), calculate the count of digit 1 in the current place (unit, tens, hundreds, ...).
Update count with the calculated count.
3.Output: Display or return the total number of digit 1 appearing as the result.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1). The code uses long data type to handle large values of n.
