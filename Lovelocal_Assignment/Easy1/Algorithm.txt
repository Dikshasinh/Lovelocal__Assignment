Algorithm lengthOfLastWord(s):
    1. Trim the input string s to remove leading and trailing spaces.
    2. Find the last space index in the trimmed string. Let lastSpaceIndex = s.lastIndexOf(' ').
    3. If lastSpaceIndex is -1, set the length of the last word to the length of the trimmed string.
    4. If lastSpaceIndex is not -1, set the length of the last word to the difference between the length of the trimmed string and lastSpaceIndex.
    5. Return the length of the last word as the result.

Algorithm main():
    1. Take a string input s from the user.
    2. Call lengthOfLastWord(s) and store the result.
    3. Display the result as the length of the last word.
